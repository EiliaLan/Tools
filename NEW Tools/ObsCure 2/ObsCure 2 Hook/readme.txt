# ObsCure 2 CRC32 Hook - info #

You need this hook only to get hashed filenames
to use them later with HVP Tools.

Output path is hardcoded, so you need to create
it on your machine or you need to compile new DLL yourself.



# Hook Usage #

To use this hook, inject DLL into running process.
You can use any DLL injector that works for you.
All filenames will be added to "obscure_2_hash_dump.txt" file.

If you could beat the whole game with this hook injected,
you could probably get ~100% of the hashes. ;)

USE THIS HOOK AT YOUR OWN RISK!
