# ObsCure 2 Hook - info #

You need this hook only to get hashed filenames
from HVP archives.

Output path is hardcoded, so you need to create
it on your machine or you need to compile new DLL yourself.


To use this hook, inject DLL into running process.
All filenames will be added to "obscure_2_hash_dump.txt" file.

USE THIS HOOK AT YOUR OWN RISK!
