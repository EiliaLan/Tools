# Tail Concerto Tools

## Info

This is set of scripts used for translating "Tail Concerto" (PS1 game) to polish language.
You can use those script to export/import texts and replace characters specific
for your language.

## Limitations

- This program works only with SLUS_006.60 (NTSC) version
of "Tail Concerto" game.
- There is a character limit for each line. Your translation can't be longer than original text. 
If your translation is longer, it will be automatically trimmed.
If it's shorter, it will be automatically filled with nulls to match expected length.
- Character mapping is adjusted for polish language, but this tool is open-source, so
nothing stops you from overwriting this with your own mapping.

## Dependencies
