# Info

Hi, on this repository you can find a collection of tools and scripts written by me.
This is result of many years devoted to reverse engineering computer and console games.

Languages used here are mostly **[Python 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29)** and **[MexScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MexScript)**.

There is no need to compile my scripts to run them, BUT they require interpreters
to run properly e.g. **[Python Interpreter](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** or **[quickBMS](http://aluigi.zenhax.com/quickbms.htm)**.

Feel free to use my tools for your game modding projects.

If you have any questions, you can **[raise an issue on Github](https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools/issues)**
or ask on **[XeNTaX forum](https://forum.xentax.com/index.php)**.
